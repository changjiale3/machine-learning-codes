+ x: total number of "success"(pass or fail, heads or tails, etc)
+ n: number of trials
+ p: probability of a success on an individual trial

#### Property
+ The number of trails is **fixed**
+ There are only **2** possible outcomes
+ The outcomes are **independent** of each other
+ The probability of success remain the **same** for each trail
